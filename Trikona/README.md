# ◁ Trikona ◁

This is a simple project to tinker with low-level graphics in haskell using open GL. As of now, launching the program creates a Sierpinski triangle which can be moved and rotated. You can change the number of iterations of the Sierpinski triangle in the main file (./lib.hs)

I initially chose Sierpinski triangles since the recursive structure lent itself to an elegant solution in a functional language like haskell.

## Dependencies

This project was written using macOS 13.14.1 and compiled using the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System (GHC), version 9.2.8. To build the file you need [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).  

## Quickstart
You can builkd the file with 
``` stack build ```
